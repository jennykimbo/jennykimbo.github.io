          <p>KIRO Radio does a <a href="http://kiroradio.com/promo/ticket_blitz.php">giveaway</a> every weekday morning for two tickets to the next home game for the Seattle Seahawks. Listen to 97.3FM at 7:30am to hear the ticket giveaway question. There will be a cue to call later on in the day when you need to be the twelfth caller AND have the correct answer to the question in order to win the tickets!</p>
